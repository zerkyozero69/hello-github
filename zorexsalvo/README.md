Hi GitHub Opensourcerers, I'm Zorex Salvo!
---

I code in Python/Django/Flask and lately I've been doing javascript also. I'm not a design-guy so I'm usually assigned to do backend stuffs.

I'm in continuous loop of learning and experimenting new technologies ergo my ever-presence on many tech conferences, hackathons, and codecamps.

I do blogs too. I write about tech, hackathon, experiences, events, anything random that comes to mind.

Check it out on my [personal site](https://zorexsalvo.com) or on [dev.to](https://dev.to/zorexsalvo)
